## Full-Stack Web Developer

### About Me
I'm Mahmut Yüksel Mert, I live in Ankara, Turkey. My expertise spans a wide range of technologies, encompassing HTML5, CSS (Less, Sass), JavaScript (Vue.js, React.js), and various JavaScript libraries. Additionally, I possess proficiency in Bootstrap and TailwindCSS. I have specialized in developing projects using prominent PHP frameworks such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, Symfony, TitanPHP, Slim, and Lumen, crafting and managing REST APIs. Alongside, I've worked on projects integrating SOAP and REST APIs for seamless communication. Collaborating actively with major platforms like N11, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram, Binance, Wordpress, and WooCommerce APIs, I bring a wealth of experience. Moreover, I've managed projects harmonizing with leading Turkish courier companies, showcasing a globally-oriented skill set.

#### Projects (Some of the projects I have worked on)
- Developed a WordPress plugin that provides estimated prices for second-hand vehicles based on specifications and allows customers to schedule vehicle inspections. This plugin communicates with an API to determine prices.
- Created Doktorbul.com, a platform resembling the MHRS system, enabling patients to filter private doctors based on specialties, affiliated hospitals, and patient reviews. The platform facilitates patient-doctor communication and includes an advanced CRM system for management.
- Built a platform enabling customers to calculate shipping costs based on package dimensions and destination. It selects the most suitable and cost-effective shipping company among courier services and manages home pickup services, overseeing the entire shipment process from creation to tracking and delivery for all courier companies. I also developed a CRM system for managing this platform.
